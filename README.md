## What is Jenkins Configuration as Code (jcasc) ? 

Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) is a plugin for Jenkins that allows you to manage the configuration of a Jenkins instance using human-readable and version-controlled configuration files, rather than using the web interface. This allows you to store the configuration of your Jenkins instance in a Git repository along with your code, making it easier to manage, version, and collaborate on the configuration.

With JCasC, you can define the configuration of your Jenkins instance using a YAML file, which specifies the various components of the Jenkins instance, such as build agents, pipelines, jobs, plugins, and system settings. When you make changes to the YAML file, you can commit and push the changes to the Git repository, and the changes will automatically be applied to the Jenkins instance.

## The benefits of using JCasC include:

- Version control: The configuration is stored in a Git repository, making it easy to track changes and revert to previous configurations if necessary.

- Collaboration: Multiple people can collaborate on the configuration, making it easier to share and review changes.

- Consistency: By using a single source of truth for the configuration, JCasC helps to ensure consistency across different Jenkins instances, making it easier to manage and maintain them.

- Automation: JCasC makes it easier to automate the setup and configuration of Jenkins instances, making it easier to scale and manage large and complex Jenkins deployments.

- Portability: By storing the configuration in a Git repository, it's easier to move a Jenkins instance to a different environment, such as a different cloud provider or on-premises data center.
